# Can all design changes happen in CSS? Using Incremental Design to create better front-end code.

## Description:  
The problem: our views are messy -- they are hard to reason about and the logic is difficult to test.  

Do we have to settle for that? Can we bring the same rigour we use when writing backend code to the front end?  Can we think about markup in the same way we think of Ruby and get our sites to a place where all design changes happen in CSS?

The answer is probably not entirely, but it’s a lofty goal to shoot for using techniques from what I am calling “Incremental Design.”

Incremental design involves setting up your code to be able to make sweeping design changes, prioritizing design requests to make each small change good enough for production, and thinking about your frontend code just as you do with your backend code.  

We will talk about decorators vs helpers, working with designers, structuring your markup and partials, and modularizing the frontend.
