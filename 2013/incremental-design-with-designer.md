# Incremental Design - A designer and developer make design changes without starting over.
# Incremental Design - A conversation between a designer and developer

## Description:  
Developers: how many times have you had to completely rip out your hard earned code for a totally new site design?
Designers: how many times has a re-design taken 4 times as long as the developer said it would and not looked good in the end?

Change all that by using an incremental approach to design.  Set up your code to change all the buttons at once or prioritize design changes to make each small change good enough for production.

A designer and developer will talk about the challenges and joys of making this process work in two production sites.
