## Format(s)

* Presentation
* Lightning talk
* Workshop

## Abstract
There’s lots of talk about getting more women into open source, but how do we do it? In addition to defining the path and showing women open source projects, we’ll discuss dealing with Imposter Syndrome, creating and looking for a welcoming open source community, and different contribution types.

## Description
There’s lots of talk about getting more women into open source, but how do we do it?

First things first, we’ll discuss where to find open source projects and how to know if one is right for you. We will also address the pink elephant in the room: Imposter Syndrome and briefly discuss moving beyond it. Welcoming open source communities exist and we’ll direct what makes them inclusive, so you can find or create one.

A version of this presentation was given at the Github Patchwork night in NYC in 2014 and came out of Code Day of Write/Speak/Code as well as my experience teaching beginners software development and helping them contribute to their first open source project.

## Audience
Intermediate and Beginner developers, designers, and product managers who are interest in participating in open source as well as open source project maintainers.

## Outcomes/Conclusions
Participants will leave the talk excited about open source with an action plan for how to participate.
