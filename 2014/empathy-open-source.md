# Comment with Compassion: Creating empathetic open source Culture

## Format(s)

* Presentation
* Lightning Talk

## Abstract
Open source powers the majority of the technology we use, yet women are sorely underrepresented in open source community. It’s not a huge secret why: we’re scared.

Open source is notorious for flame wars and cruel code comments, which contributes to the lack of diversity. In this talk, we’ll look at the elements of empathy and how we can apply them to open source communities. 

## Description
Open source powers the majority of the technology we use, yet women are sorely underrepresented in open source community. It’s not a huge secret why: we’re scared.

Open source is notorious for flame wars and cruel code comments, which contributes to the lack of diversity. In this talk, we’ll look at the elements of empathy and how we can apply them to open source communities.

A version of this presentation was given at Coder Day of Service 2014 in NYC and came out of my experience teaching beginner software developers “Engineering Empathy” and about open source.

## Audience
Intermediate and Beginner developers, designers, and product managers who are interest in participating in open source as well as open source project maintainers.

## Outcomes/Conclusions
Participants will leave the talk with tools for creating welcoming communities, more self-awareness around empathy and shame, and how to determine if an open source project is welcoming.
