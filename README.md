## Why?

I'm keeping my talk proposals here for a few reasons:

1. I need a central place to keep them
2. By publicly sharing my talk proposals and ideas as well as
   submissions and rejects, I hope to demystify
   the speaking process for others and inspire them to submit talks.
3. By publicly sharing my talk proposals and ideas, I hope to speak
   more.
