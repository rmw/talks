## Outline

- person and organization both struggle with
- ritual but not yes-men or dogmatism or drinking the koolaid
- boundaries between work & play; work and home; personal and organization; code/architecture boundaries
- stillness - next uber for dog poop? listen and see nature - grounded in reality.  real problems
- structure - too many meetings vs. not enough
- discipline - stick to the process, rituals, boundaries, structure even when

## Brainstorm/Notes
Part of growing up has involved embracing this I rebelled against and
finding the nuanced balance of why you rebelled and why it's necessary.
Realizing that many of those things - from brushing my teeth and going
to bed on time to eating dinner at the table.

Industries and organizations have these same struggles, because tech is
fundamentally about people.  What are these pillars of adulthood
