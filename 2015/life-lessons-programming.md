# Programming makes us better!

## Abstract
We all know that the loner hacker in his basement surrounded by empty
pizza boxes is (mostly) a myth, but coding is more than just a good
living or even lots of fun.  I believe that being a software engineer
can actually make us better humans.
From learning to let go, constant learning, community, and
prioritization, the world would be better if more people learned these
lessons!
