# Democracy isn’t enough — a bill of rights for the web

## Format

* Full talk
* Lightning Talk
* Ignite Talk

## Abstract
Talking about “democratization” of technology and the internet is just a part of the narrative of the industry these days.  But what does “democratization” really mean?  What does the history of democracy in the United States and around the world tell us about the future of the internet?  Can we learn from the history of governments and create an even better internet?

I believe that the history of democracy and its challenges can help us move technology forward for the good of society *if we choose to listen.*
