# Static Site Generators IRL (in real life)

## Abstract
Maybe you're using static site generators, such as Middleman or Jekyll for 
your blog or personal site.  But you can, and many have, used static
site generators for much more than that!  From prototyping to landing
pages to simple data-driven sites, static site generators can solve your
problems with the speed of pure HTML and the developer-ease of Rails!

## Description
Maybe you're using static site generators, such as Middleman or Jekyll for 
your blog or personal site.  But you can, and many have, used static
site generators for much more than that!  From prototyping to landing
pages to simple data-driven sites, static site generators can solve your
problems with the speed of pure HTML and the developer-ease of Rails!

We all know that pure HTML files are the fastest options for sites, but
the downsides of coding numerous HTML files generally outway that speed.
Static site generators allow us to have pure HTML sites while still
using modern development practices, including DRY principles.

Focusing on Middleman, we'll look at the benefits of using a static site
generator, including partials, layouts, and SASS.  Then we'll walk
through real life examples of how Middleman has been used within
organizations.  You'll walk away with ideas for how you can use static
site generators for development and user speed!
