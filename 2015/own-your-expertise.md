## Description
Solidifying and owning your expertise — your knowledge and experience — is the foundation of speaking at conferences contributing to open source, and changing the world!

Own Your Expertise will include an introduction to Imposter Syndrome and the factors that contribute to woman downplaying their accomplishments.  Then we will go through proven exercises and learn tools and techniques for framing yourself as an expert and presenting your accomplishments with confidence.

This workshop is an abbreviated workshop of a day-long Write/Speak/Code workshop and has been given to audiences as large as 100 people.  The exercises are individual or small group based and can scale to any size.

## Audience
This workshop is for any technical woman who doesn’t think she is an expert and any technical woman who has not spoken, written, or publicly expressed her expertise. 

While it may seem that this talk to for students and early career professionals, we at Write/Speak/Code have found that our resident “experts” get just as much out of our workshops as the attendees.   This workshop has been powerful for women just beginning in tech to woman who have been in the industry for 15 years. 

## Outcomes/Conclusions
Attendees will leave the workshop with an understanding of Imposter Syndrome and societal factors that contribute to their feelings about their success.  They will generate a list of accomplishments, write about their values, and learn exercises they can work into their daily lives in the future.
