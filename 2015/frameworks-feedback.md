# Frameworks for Feedback

## Format

* Full talk
* Lightning Talk
* Ignite Talk

## Abstract
Everyone in tech deals with people — other devs, people in other departments, managers, users, etc. Agile and other tools give us time to give feedback, but they don’t always tell us how to give feedback. Giving feedback to someone who doesn’t hear it is just an exercise in futility.

—

Code reviews, stand up, retros, and performance reviews — all these acknowledge the importance of communication and feedback and they are good starts.  But they don’t tell you how to actually say something negative to someone or how to ensure that  you, as a teammate or manager, hear the small things before they become big things.

Let’s talk about frameworks for how to ask for and frame feedback effectively.  Not all situations call for the same type of feedback and some are more sensitive than others.  We will look at Non-violent communication, techniques from family and marriage therapy, as well as more traditional frameworks for feedback.

## Description

Code reviews, stand up, and retros — all these acknowledge the importance of communication and feedback. Agile gives us a time for feedback, but doesn’t help to actually say something negative to someone or how to ensure that you, as a teammate or manager, hear the small things before they become big things. Giving feedback to someone who doesn’t hear it is frustrating and futile.

Let’s talk about how to ask for and frame feedback effectively. We will look at Non-violent communication, techniques from family and marriage therapy, as well as more traditional frameworks for feedback.

## Audience
Developers, designers, managers, QA, and product managers — anyone who deals with people will benefit from his talk!

## Outcomes/Conclusions
You’ll leave with concrete techniques to use to give feedback along with the pros and cons and when its best to use each one.
