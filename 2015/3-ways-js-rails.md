# 3 Ways to Use JavaScript in your Rails App

## Abstract
You've learned some JavaScript and some Rails and even how to connect
the two with AJAX.  But how do you really bring complicated JavaScript
together with your server without duplicating code or doing weird
stuff to connect the two? What's going on behind the scenes in all those JavaScript frameworks?

In this talk, we'll discuss the three standard ways to connect
JavaScript with Rails: html fragments, JSON, and bootstrapping your
Javascript.  Then we'll talk about the pros and cons of each approach.
You'll leave the talk able to assess the best approach for your app's
needs.
