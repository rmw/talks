# How to call people out: Microaggressions & creating cultural change

## Format

* Workshop
* Full talk
* Lightning Talk

## Abstract
You are in a meeting and for the fifth time, someone cuts you off without acknowledging it or letting you finish your thought.  What do you do?

These often unintentional daily acts that reinforce stereotypes and oppression are insidious in tech and business culture and so difficult to respond to.  Should you say something? When? Will they get defensive and how will you justify it?

We’ll learn about microaggressions and some tools to respond to them.  In pairs and small groups, we’ll practice scripts and techniques to call someone out and in the process, change the culture of an organization.

## Description
Microaggressions are unintentional, daily acts that reinforce stereotypes.  The act of naming an experience can be profoundly catharic and eye opening.  We will learn about different types of micro aggressions and discuss stories of real women in tech who have experienced them.  

Learn a number of tools and techniques to responding to micro aggressions in its various forms.  Then put those techniques into practice by role playing with other participants.

In my role as teacher and Diversity Advocate at Dev Bootcamp, I delivered workshops on Stereotypes, Sexism, and Microaggressions to over 150 students, Gender Bias in Teaching to 10 teachers and staff in NYC, and developed Implicit Bias & Microaggressions training for all staff in the organization.

The work in this can be done in pairs or small groups and can scale to any number.  However, I’ve found that for sensitive topics, it is best to keep the total number around 25 people.

This could also be put into presentation or lightning talk form.


## Audience
This workshop is intended for all technical women.  We will discuss and name the experiences we’ve all had in school and the workplace. Then we’ll share and practice techniques for responding.

## Outcomes/Conclusions
Participants will leave the workshop able to name the common, uncomfortable experiences they have daily in tech and armed with tools and techniques to respond to those experiences with confidence and safety.
