# Teaching microaggressions to create cultural change

## Format(s)

* Workshop
* *possibly* presentation

## Abstract
You are in a meeting and for the fifth time, someone cuts you off without acknowledging it or letting you finish your thought. 

Microaggressions are unintentional, daily acts that reinforce stereotypes.  The act of naming an experience can be profoundly cathartic and eye opening. Teaching microaggressions was eye opening and encouraging.  This talk will discuss lessons I’ve learned from teaching an entire organization as well as over 150 beginning software developers of all genders about microaggressions.


## Description
Microaggressions are unintentional, daily acts that reinforce stereotypes.  The act of naming an experience can be profoundly cathartic and eye opening. Teaching microaggressions was eye opening and encouraging.  This talk will discuss lessons I’ve learned from teaching an entire organization as well as over 150 beginning software developers of all genders about microaggressions.

In my role as teacher and Diversity Advocate at Dev Bootcamp, I delivered workshops on Stereotypes, Sexism, and Microaggressions to over 150 students, Gender Bias in Teaching to 10 teachers and staff in NYC, and developed Implicit Bias & Microaggressions training for all staff in the organization.

The work in this can be done in pairs or small groups and can scale to any number.  However, I’ve found that for sensitive topics, it is best to keep the total number around 25 people.

## Audience
This workshop is intended for anyone who works in tech, especially those in leadership positions interested in creating organizational change.

## Outcomes/Conclusions
Participants will leave the workshop able to name the common, uncomfortable experiences and as well as with an understanding of how and when to have these conversations in their own organization.

Teaching new developers about sexism in tech
- it’s not a good time
- it might cause an uproar in the short term - commit to the hard work
- are you reacting with sexism? 
- what does it mean to be “safe”?
- individual feels vs. group
- avoiding tokenism
- young, middle class, white women
- talking for real (stories, micro aggressions etc)
