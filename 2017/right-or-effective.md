## Abstract

"Do you want to be right or do you want to be effective?"

This was advice given to me by my first mentor and I have carried it with me throughout my career. It's use has been constant - from group technology decisions to managing humans to dealing with stakeholders. But my understanding of it has evolved with each new role I've been in. For example, how do you handle a situation where you are effective but at a high cost? What does effective even mean? I'm going to explore what I've learned about this dichotomy, go into specific examples and discuss the places this challenges me the most.
