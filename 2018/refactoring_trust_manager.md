Trust is at the core of successful software teams.  It is the basis of retention and defines how your team sees you.

But what is trust?  How do you know when it's missing?  And how do you fix it when it's gone?

Let's discuss the elements of trust and what you can do to refactor trust on your team.

## Description
Trust is at the core of successful, functional, effective software teams.  It defines whether our teams are happy at work and is the basis of retention.

Trust is at the center of whether people perceive us to be good at our jobs and how your team sees you as a leader.

But what is trust?  How do you know when it's missing?  And how do you fix it when it's gone?

## Outline

## Pitch
I am kind of obsessed with this topic.  I refactored a gossipy and untrusting team by talking about (and rating each other!)
on the elements of trust as well as thinking about how my actions do or do not support trustworthiness with my team and clients.
I'll talk about both regular and organizational psychological research on the subject as well as my personal experience as
a teammate and a manager on various teams.
