## Description
As more and more popular news is consumed with the ways that software
and the data it collects can be used to manipulate society, more and
more engineers are thinking about the ethical implications of their
work.

As leader, how do you handle this conversation?  What happens when
engineers refuse to implement a feature that the business wants?  How do
you facilitate a conversation about divisive topics?

I'll talk about how I handled multiple ethic conversations with my team
as well as into how to frame and think about ethical decision
making.  You'll walk a way with tools to have these conversations with
your own team.

## Why Me?

In the course of the last year, I've encountered a number of ethic
decisions that I had to make with my team: from should we work with
these people to can we create an inclusive interface while supporting
legacy data validation to should we collect data that we know can be
weaponized.

At previous companies, I've also facilitated conversations about
oppression and inclusion and heped multiple start ups create their first
sexual harassment policies and procedures.
