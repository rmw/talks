## Outline

## Pitch
I am kind of obsessed with this topic.  I refactored a gossipy and untrusting team by talking about (and rating each other!)
on the elements of trust as well as thinking about how my actions do or do not support trustworthiness with my team and clients.
I'll talk about both regular and organizational psychological research on the subject as well as my personal experience as
a teammate and a manager on various teams.
