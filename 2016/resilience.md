# Building resilience in our organizations, our teams, and ourselves

## Format

* Full talk
* Lightning Talk

## Abstract

We talk about redundancy and security when it comes to our infrastructure and
applications, but we rarely think about creating those same
things in our teams and ourselves.  

From the start-up financial roller coaster to a teammate's
marriage (or divorce) to our own personal issues, success, scaling, and our future
depend on complex and often chaotic factors.  

In order to succeed, we need to create resilience, not just in our technology, but
also in our organizations, our teams, and ourselves.

## Description
We talk about redundancy and security when it comes to our infrastructure and
applications, but we rarely think about creating those same
things in our teams and ourselves.  

Yet we all know that humans are hard, hiring and retaining engineers is extremely difficult
and more and more companies are focusing on culture.  We need more than
meetings, training, and social events.

From the start-up financial roller coaster to a teammate's
marriage (or divorce) to our own personal issues, success, scaling, and our future
depend on complex and often chaotic factors.  


In order to succeed, we need to create resilience, not just in our technology, but
also in our organizations, our teams, and ourselves.

## Pitch

This is a topic I've been thinking and reading a lot about lately.  Being a part of start-ups for many years with their rollercoaster of changes started it off.  Now that I am a manager, it is seeing teams and organizations from a whole other perspective.  I have also had some serious personal struggles over the last couple years that has left me actively seeking techniques and tools for resiliency.

How do you handle layoffs effectively?  How do you come in and create change or make change from the inside out?

## Audience
Anyone, but particularly geared towards those working on an engineering team at
a small/medium company that is growing.

## Outcomes/Conclusions
You'll come away with new ideas for thinking about engineering culture, retention,
management, and team communication/relationships.  You'll also come away with
some personal food-for-thought.
