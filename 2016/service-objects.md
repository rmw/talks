# All the service objects

## Format

* Full talk
* Lightning Talk

## Abstract
As rails applications get bigger, we talk more and more about managing the growing
complexity of our apps.  Maybe
you've heard about presenters or decorators or serializers.  Maybe your head is
swimming with jargon and you're confused about what to be used where.  Maybe you
feel terrified of the class bloat you've seen when using Java or .NET.

Let's talk about service objects.  What they are and how they differ from Rails
concerns.  We'll discuss how you can use service objects to
make your app simpler for future developers, more testable, and
easier to scale.

## Description
A few paragraphs.

## Pitch
As I've mentored and managed more and more developers, I've realized there's a gap in their understanding of design patterns and options for architecting their application. Rails concerns often confuse this issue. As apps grow, developers often struggle to refactor in meaningful and helpful ways.

## Audience
Beginner and Intermediate Rails Developers

## Outcomes/Conclusions
Developers will come away with a better understanding of using non-controller/model
objects in their web apps and examples of how to create objects that will lead
to more extensible, understandable, and scalable code.
