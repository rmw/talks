# JavaScript and Rails: What you thought you knew

# The client and the server: What you thought you knew

## Abstract

New JavaScript frameworks and libraries popping up everywhere.  Code that was once only on
the server is now performing beautifully on the client.  Data that once only lived
in one part of your application is needed everywhere.  

But the truth is that the internet -- its fundamental protocols and constraints -- hasn't
changed much in the last couple decades.  We've just gotten better at working
within those constraints.  Maybe we've gotten too good.

Let's revisit the fundamentals of interacting with the client and
the server.  We'll discuss the basic ways to connect JavaScript with Rails.
You'll leave the talk able to assess the best approach for your app's
needs and a deeper understanding of how the libraries and frameworks you use work
under the hood.

Here's the thing: the internet hasn't changed that much in the last couple decades.
We write more code in more languages for more devices.  UI are much nicer. Really,
we've just gotten better at working within the fundamental constraints of the internet.
Maybe we've gotten too good.

Let's revisit the fundamentals of interacting with the client and
the server.  We'll discuss the basic ways to connect JavaScript with Rails.
You'll leave the talk able to assess the best approach for your app's

## Description
New JavaScript frameworks and libraries popping up everywhere.  Code that was once only on
the server is now performing beautifully on the client.  Data that once only lived
in one part of your application is needed everywhere.  

But now we have a whole other set of problems.  How do you really bring complicated
JavaScript together with your server without duplicating code or performing
code magic tricks?  What's really going on behind the scenes in those JavaScript
frameworks?

The truth is that the internet -- its fundamental protocols and constraints -- hasn't
changed much in the last couple decades.  We've just gotten better at working
within those constraints.  Maybe we've gotten too good.

Let's revisit the fundamentals of interacting with the client and
the server.  We'll discuss the basic ways to connect JavaScript with Rails:
html fragments, JSON, and bootstrapping your JavaScript.  
Then we'll talk about the pros and cons of each approach.
You'll leave the talk able to assess the best approach for your app's
needs and a deeper understanding of how the libraries and frameworks you use work
under the hood.

## Pitch

I came up for the idea for this talk after teaching people how to code and realizing many people were not aware of the fundamentals. I also couldn't find a good resource describing the options. It struck me that even after almost 15 years and regardless of web framework or language, the techniques, constraints, and trade-offs really remain the same.

## Audience
Beginner to Intermediate Rails/JS developers.

*Possible to generalize outside of Rails*

## Outcomes/Conclusions
Audience will leave the talk knowing how to connect JavaScript and
Rails (the server) and the pros and cons of various approaches.
