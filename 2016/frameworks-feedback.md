# Frameworks for Feedback

## Format

* Full talk
* Lightning Talk
* Ignite Talk
* Workshop

## Abstract

Code reviews, stand up, retros, and performance reviews — all acknowledge the importance of communication and feedback and they are good starts.  But they don’t tell you how to give negative feedback or  ensure that you, as a teammate or manager, hear the small things before they become big things.

Let’s talk about feedback and examine frameworks for how to ask for and frame feedback effectively.  Not all situations call for the same type of feedback and some are more sensitive than others.  We will look at Non-violent communication, techniques from family and marriage therapy, as well as more traditional frameworks for feedback.

## Description

Code reviews, stand up, and retros — all these acknowledge the importance of communication and feedback. Agile gives us a time for feedback, but doesn’t help us give negative feedback or  ensure that you, as a teammate or manager, hear the small things before they become big things. Giving feedback to someone who doesn’t hear it is frustrating and futile.

Let’s talk about how to ask for and frame feedback effectively. We will look at Non-violent communication, techniques from family and marriage therapy, as well as more traditional frameworks for feedback.

## Pitch
People are hard. Communication is hard. Feedback is hard.

Feedback is incredibly important. Studies have shown that's it's progress -- not completion -- that is the driving motivator for most people. Feedback is the type of communication that tells us how we are doing.

I have managed teams and led workshops for hundreds of people on communication, feedback, leadership, difficult conversations, public speaking, and oppression.

## Audience
Developers, designers, managers, QA, and product managers — anyone who deals with people will benefit from his talk!

## Outcomes/Conclusions
You’ll leave with concrete techniques to use to give, receive and request feedback along techniques for having difficult conversations.
